create workers/gov_uk_push_worker.rb

class GovUkPushWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(court_id)
    CourtSerializer ......
  end
end

Then in the GovUkPushable concern, GovUkWorker.perform_async(court_id)


Serializer.

 - instantiate the court
 - serialize everything
 - validate against schema
 - create md5
 - compare with last md5
 - instantiate GovUkApiClient client and push
 - rsesponse, udpdate with url and md5


GovUkApiClient

  instantiates with court, and 

 - push to gov uk
 - check response
 - update court with new md5 if successful




 

TEst that when an address/contact etc is destroyed, a gov uk court update job is triggered

JSON VALIDATORS
===============


jschema - https://github.com/Soylent/jschema
validate works OK with their test data, but fails oin our schema with:
    
    JSchema::InvalidSchema: Specified schema version is not supported

********


ruby-jsonchema - https://github.com/Constellation/ruby-jsonchema
cannot install using bundler


*********

json-schema - https://github.com/ruby-json-schema/json-schema

works OK with test data, but using our schema, we get: 

Failure/Error: result = v.validate
     Errno::ENOENT:
       No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - {
           "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",

works ok if I remove the $schema line from the schema.
