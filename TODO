install redis

install sidekiq gem


create workers/gov_uk_push_worker.rb

class GovUkPushWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(court_id)
    CourtSerializer ......
  end
end

Then in the GovUkPushable concern, GovUkWorker.perform_async(court_id)


Serializer.

 - instantiate the court
 - serialize everything
 - create md5
 - compare with last md5
 - push to gov uk
 - check response
 - update court with new md5 if successful

 

TEst that when an address/contact etc is destroyed, a gov uk court update job is triggered
