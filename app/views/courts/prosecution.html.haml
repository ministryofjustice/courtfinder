  ##  Roles and Responsibilities

  **The Witness Care Unit:** The Witness Care Unit is part of the joint Police and Crown Prosecution team and is responsible for providing you, with support, information on the progress of your case and making the arrangements for you to attend Court. The Witness Care Unit should be your first point of contact.

  **The Witness Service:** The Witness Service helps witnesses and victims, their families and friends before, during and after a court hearing. It is a national charity, which helps people cope with crime. If you come to court to give evidence a Witness Service representative will offer you support.

  ##  Before you arrive

  You can arrange with the Witness Service or Witness Care Unit to visit the Court in advance of the trial.
  This may make you feel more confident about attending Court to give evidence. If you think this might help, please call the Witness Service or the Witness Care Unit using the contact details provided.

  If you feel you need to wait away from the public area please tell the Court Usher or Witness Service representative who will try to make alternative arrangements. Family and friends attending with you may not be allowed to wait in the witness waiting areas, in which case they will be seated elsewhere away from the defendant wherever possible. Ask the Witness Service before attending

  If you have particular needs, possibly arising out of a disability or religious observance, please let someone know in advance of the day you are due to attend by contacting the Witness Care Unit or by calling the Witness Service - please see contact details for information.

  If you are a child or young witness, special arrangements for your needs will be made by the Witness Care Unit.

  There are no facilities for children, who are not witnesses, to be looked after at court so avoid bringing children with you if possible. If you wish to discuss alternative care arrangements please contact the Witness Care Unit.

  If you have to bring your child to court, please bring an adult friend or relative to sit with them whilst you give your evidence, as Court staff are unable to help.

  It is important to inform the Witness Care Unit if you have any difficulties attending on the date you have been asked to attend. Please ensure that you have confirmed in advance with the Witness Care Unit that you will be attending on the date and at the time specified.

  Please let the Witness Care Unit, know preferably in advance of the trial if you have any commitments during the day which cannot be changed, for example, children at school who need to be collected.

  ##  On arrival

  You should arrive at Court at the time notified to you by the Witness Care Unit which is usually 30 minutes before the trial or hearing is due to start. If you anticipate any difficulties with getting to the court on time on the day, please notify the Witness Care Unit immediately. It is important that the Court knows of any possible delay otherwise it may think that you are not coming.

  You, as with other court users, will be required to undergo standard security checks.

  Unless special arrangements have been made for you, when you arrive at court please go straight to the reception point, tell the receptionist your name and that you are a prosecution witness.

  If you have asked for support from the Witness Service, you will be introduced to their representative who will take you to a waiting area.

  ##  Before you give evidence

  Arrangements can be made for you to see where you will be giving evidence. Generally this is done at a pre-trial visit, although this may occasionally be possible on the day. Please ask the Court Usher or the Witness Service representative.

  You will give evidence in a courtroom, or in a room away from the court if special arrangements have been made for you i.e video links.

  It might be a while since you have seen the written or video statement which you made to the police. You should be given the chance to see it again before you give evidence. If not, then please ask the Crown Prosecution Service representative at court. It might help to refresh your memory.

  Oath taking procedures will be explained to you and you will be asked whether you want to swear to tell the truth on the holy book of your religion or whether you wish to make an affirmation, which is a non-religious way of swearing to tell the truth. If you are a witness in a Youth Court you will promise to tell the truth or affirm. You will be asked about other rituals and practices you may want to observe before giving evidence.

  Light refreshments may be available for you to buy. See the facilities section for more information.

  You may have access to en-suite toilet facilities or toilets within close proximity to your waiting area.

  We aim to call you to give your evidence within two hours of the start time, although this is not always possible.

  We will provide you with regular updates on the progress of the case and explain the reasons for any delay, where possible. If you are likely to have to wait a long time, the court will consider letting you leave court to return at a later time.

  ##  Giving your evidence

  **You will** be accompanied usually by the court usher or a member of the Witness Service to the courtroom, where you are going to give your evidence.

  In the courtroom, you will be asked by the Court Usher to take the oath or affirm in accordance with the procedures already explained.

  If you are not required to give evidence the reason for this will be explained to you.

  ##  After you have given your evidence

  When you have finished giving your evidence you will be thanked for attending and will be told whether you are allowed to leave. If you wish to stay and watch the rest of the case, this will be arranged if the Court agrees.

  ##  After your case has finished

  You will be told the result of your case by the Witness Care Unit who will also be able to provide you with information about any further support you may need.

  You may be able to claim the cost of having to come to court. You can ask the Witness Care Unit which has asked you to come to court for an application form before the trial. You can also request a claim form from the CPS representative at court or the Witness Care Unit after your trial. If you have receipts, you should send these with your claim.

  If the defendant appeals against the decision of the Court, the Witness Care Unit will tell you about this and will explain the procedures involved.
