  ##  Help and advice

  If you have any concerns about coming to court or the court experience please speak to a member of staff. Court staff can advise you on procedures, give you the forms you need and help you fill them in. They cannot however give you legal advice. You may be able to get free legal advice from a law centre, a Citizens Advice Bureau or consumer advice centre or alternatively you can contact the Legal Aid Agency, www.gov.uk/legal-aid. County Courts only: If you want to settle your dispute without going to court, find a civil mediation provider at www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/.

  ## What additional help is available for court users with a disability?

  ## Personal belongings

  Court staff cannot look after your personal belongings and cannot be held responsible for their safety. Do not leave bags unattended. Please also note that court users are not permitted to use recording equipment, photography, mobile telephones and pagers in courtrooms. Security at court is of paramount importance to HMCTS and we work to ensure that all visitors to court, including victims and witnesses are in a safe and secure environment. Sharp objects such as knives are not allowed in the court building and if brought to court they will be removed by security and will not be returned when you leave. If carrying a kirpan this must be concealed and the overall length must not exceed 6 inches, (2 inches handle, 4 inches blade).
