ISSUES
======
JSON schema validation:
 
  - have had to remove the $schema line in order to get the schema validator to work
          "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",


SANITZE
========




DX number
=========

DX number is attached to an address, not a court.  I take the lowest of them alphanetically after excluding emtpy strings and nulls



Client
======


Credentials
============
Client endpoint and token are in config/gov_uk_api.yml.  Should this be in a salt pillar rather than the code repo?



SSL certs checking:
==================
 - turned off for now in the client  (gov_uk_api_client.rb:56)
